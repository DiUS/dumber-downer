== Dumber Downer

This is a Rails-based Twitter client which automatically either dumbs-down or 'dumbs-up' tweets as a light-hearted example of using the SpringSense Meaning Recognition API.

Currently requires environment variables to be set up with the appropriate secrets for the Twitter API & SpringSense API: 
MASHAPE_PUBLIC_KEY, MASHAPE_PRIVATE_KEY, TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN, TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET, TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY & TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
